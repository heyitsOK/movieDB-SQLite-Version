SQLite3 Database file is in the same directory the filename is 'movieDB.db'.
Although the database will be submitted in its initial state I have provided 
the database initializer in case you want to change the data then bring it back
to its initial state or the database has any issues. To run the initializer use
the command 'node ./database-initializer.js'. To run the server you must start 
by installing all the dependencies; this can be done using the command 'npm install'
Once the installation is finished use the command 'node server.js' to run the
server locally on 'localhost:3000'.

The video demonstration of the web application and database is unlisted at the
